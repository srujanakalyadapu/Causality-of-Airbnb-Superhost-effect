# Causality-of-Airbnb-Superhost-effect
This study explores the impact of the 'Super host' badge on Airbnb occupancy rates in Chicago. The focus is on how the badge influences occupancy and how property managers can leverage it along with strategic pricing to enhance revenue. The study utilizes advanced statistical methods to uncover the effects of this badge and to guide marketing strategies for optimal pricing.

## Business Problem
The central business problem is understanding how the 'Super host' badge affects Airbnb property performance in terms of occupancy rates. Specifically, the study addresses:
* The direct impact of obtaining the 'Super host' badge on the occupancy rates of Airbnb properties.
* Developing effective marketing strategies for property managers and hosts to optimize pricing and maximize revenue in a competitive market.
* 
## Methodology
The approach includes several sophisticated analytical techniques:
* Time-Series Analysis and Treatment Effect: Used to quantify the occupancy rate changes before and after obtaining the 'Super host' badge.
* Difference in Difference Estimation: Helps isolate the impact of becoming a Super host from other factors that could affect occupancy rates.
* KNN Clustering for Price Optimization: Segments properties into unique clusters based on various attributes to tailor pricing strategies effectively.
* Regression Analysis: Logarithmic regression of occupancy rates to understand the interaction effects of time periods and Super host status on occupancy rates.
* Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: Ensuring data integrity and compatibility for analysis through methods like missing value imputation, data standardization, and transformation of categorical features.
## Results and Conclusion
The findings from the study indicate:
* Properties with the 'Super host' badge experience approximately a 3% increase in occupancy rates due to the badgeâ€™s influence.
KNN clustering identified three distinct property segments in Chicago, enabling targeted marketing and pricing strategies:
* Cluster 0 (Essential Comforts): Showed the highest nightly rate suggesting a premium property segment.
* Cluster 1 (Highly Rated Retreats): Focused on properties highly rated for their cleanliness and service.
* Cluster 2 (Popular Picks): Featured properties with frequent bookings, indicating a high engagement level with guests.
Economic segmentation and optimized pricing strategies led to differentiated pricing across clusters, enhancing revenue potential per cluster.

The study's implications suggest that Airbnb could enhance host performance by slightly relaxing the Super host criteria, particularly for hosts who narrowly miss the badge, thereby potentially increasing overall platform revenue and host satisfaction.
